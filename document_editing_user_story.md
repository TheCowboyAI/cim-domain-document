# Document Editing with Successor CID Chains - User Story

## Overview

This user story defines the requirements for document editing functionality that supports both human and machine-driven document modifications through a successor CID chain pattern, enabling collaborative editing while maintaining immutable content addressability.

## User Story

**As a** document author/editor/system  
**I want to** create successor versions of documents through direct replacement or differential patches  
**So that** I can maintain version history, collaborate effectively, and preserve content integrity in a CID-based system

## Acceptance Criteria

### US-024: Document Successor Creation

#### AC-024.1: Direct Replacement Pattern
**Given** a document with CID `original_cid`  
**When** I submit a complete replacement document  
**Then** the system should:
- Generate a new `successor_cid` for the replacement content
- Create a Document<T> -> Document<T> relationship
- Maintain the CID chain: `original_cid` -> `successor_cid`
- Preserve all metadata and component relationships
- Update the document aggregate with the new content address

#### AC-024.2: Differential Patch Pattern  
**Given** a document with CID `original_cid` and a diff patch  
**When** I submit `(CID + Diff) -> SuccessorCID`  
**Then** the system should:
- Apply the diff to the original content
- Generate `successor_cid` from the patched result
- Store both the original CID and diff for reconstruction
- Create MerkleDAG linking: `original_cid` + `diff` -> `successor_cid`
- Maintain patch history for efficient storage

#### AC-024.3: Human Editor Workflow
**Given** I am a human editor  
**When** I want to edit a document  
**Then** I should be able to:
- Export the document content for external editing
- Edit using any external program/tool
- Submit either complete replacement or diff patch
- Have the system validate and create successor automatically
- Receive confirmation with new CID and version info

#### AC-024.4: Machine Editor Workflow
**Given** I am an automated system/AI  
**When** I need to modify a document programmatically  
**Then** I should be able to:
- Access document content via CID
- Apply transformations (formatting, correction, translation, etc.)
- Submit successor via API with appropriate metadata
- Chain multiple automated edits efficiently
- Integrate with workflow approval if required

#### AC-024.5: CID Chain Integrity
**Given** multiple document edits over time  
**When** I examine the document history  
**Then** I should see:
- Complete CID chain from original to current
- Verifiable content integrity at each step
- Efficient diff-based storage for space optimization
- Ability to reconstruct any version from chain
- Cryptographic proof of edit authenticity

## Detailed Requirements

### 1. Document Successor Structure

```rust
/// Represents a document edit operation creating a successor
pub struct DocumentSuccessor {
    /// Original document CID
    pub predecessor_cid: Cid,
    /// New document CID after edit
    pub successor_cid: Cid,
    /// Type of edit operation
    pub edit_type: EditType,
    /// Edit metadata
    pub edit_metadata: EditMetadata,
    /// Content addressing information
    pub content_info: SuccessorContentInfo,
}

pub enum EditType {
    /// Complete document replacement
    DirectReplacement,
    /// Patch-based differential edit
    DifferentialPatch { patch_cid: Cid },
    /// Structured edit with specific changes
    StructuredEdit { changes: Vec<ContentChange> },
}
```

### 2. Content Management Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Direct Replacement
```
[Original Document CID] -> [New Document CID]
Storage: Full content at both CIDs
Pros: Simple, fast access
Cons: Higher storage cost for large documents
```

#### Pattern 2: Differential Storage  
```
[Original CID] + [Patch CID] -> [Successor CID]  
Storage: Original + compressed diffs
Pros: Storage efficient, detailed history
Cons: Reconstruction cost for old versions
```

#### Pattern 3: Hybrid Approach
```
[Base CID] + [Diff1] + [Diff2] + [Diff3] -> [Current CID]
With periodic full snapshots for performance
```

### 3. Use Cases

#### UC-1: Human Document Editor
1. User requests edit access to Document ID `doc123`
2. System provides current content via CID lookup  
3. User edits in external tool (Word, VSCode, etc.)
4. User submits edited file back to system
5. System creates successor CID and updates document
6. Workflow triggers if approval required

#### UC-2: Automated Content Processing
1. AI system processes document for grammar correction
2. System applies corrections generating diff
3. System submits `(original_cid + grammar_diff) -> corrected_cid`
4. Document updated with successor maintaining edit audit

#### UC-3: Collaborative Editing  
1. Multiple users create successor branches
2. System maintains parallel CID chains  
3. Merge operation combines changes
4. Final successor represents merged state

#### UC-4: Content Pipeline Processing
1. Document enters processing pipeline
2. Stage 1: Format conversion `cid1 -> cid2`  
3. Stage 2: Content analysis `cid2 -> cid3`
4. Stage 3: Enrichment `cid3 -> cid4`
5. Each stage creates successor with full audit trail

### 4. Technical Implementation Requirements

#### CID Chain Management
- Efficient storage of predecessor/successor relationships
- Fast traversal of version history  
- Garbage collection of unused CIDs
- Integrity verification of chain links

#### Diff Processing
- Support for text, binary, and structured diffs
- Compression for storage efficiency
- Fast patch application algorithms
- Conflict resolution for concurrent edits

#### Content Addressing
- Integration with IPFS/IPLD for content storage
- Merkle DAG construction and verification  
- Content deduplication across versions
- Efficient retrieval of any version

## Test Scenarios

### Test Scenario 1: Simple Text Edit
```
Given: Document "Hello World" with CID abc123
When: User edits to "Hello Universe"  
Then: New CID xyz789 created
And: Chain abc123 -> xyz789 established
And: Both versions retrievable
```

### Test Scenario 2: Large Binary File Edit
```  
Given: PDF document with CID pdf456
When: User updates single page
Then: Efficient diff created and stored
And: Successor CID generated
And: Original accessible without full reconstruction
```

### Test Scenario 3: Automated Processing Chain
```
Given: Raw document CID raw123
When: Processing pipeline applies 5 transformations
Then: CID chain raw123 -> clean456 -> format789 -> enrich012 -> final345
And: Each step independently verifiable
And: Rollback to any intermediate state possible
```

### Test Scenario 4: Concurrent Edit Resolution
```
Given: Document CID base123
When: Two users create successors concurrently
Then: Both successors base123 -> edit1_456 and base123 -> edit2_789
And: Merge operation creates base123 -> edit1_456 -> merged_012
                                 \-> edit2_789 -/
```

## Error Handling

### E-1: Invalid CID
- **Scenario**: User submits successor for non-existent CID
- **Response**: Return error with valid CID list
- **Recovery**: Guide user to correct CID

### E-2: Patch Application Failure  
- **Scenario**: Diff cannot be applied to original content
- **Response**: Validation error with conflict details
- **Recovery**: Provide conflict resolution options

### E-3: Storage Failure
- **Scenario**: Network/storage error during CID generation
- **Response**: Rollback partial changes
- **Recovery**: Retry with exponential backoff

### E-4: Chain Corruption
- **Scenario**: CID chain integrity check fails
- **Response**: Alert and isolate corrupted segment  
- **Recovery**: Rebuild from last known good state

## Performance Considerations

### Storage Efficiency
- Target: <20% overhead for diff-based storage vs direct
- Compression: Use efficient diff algorithms (bsdiff, xdelta)  
- Deduplication: Share common content across versions

### Retrieval Performance  
- Target: <100ms for recent version retrieval
- Target: <1s for historical version reconstruction
- Caching: Cache frequently accessed versions
- Indexing: Optimize CID chain traversal

### Scalability
- Support: 10,000+ versions per document
- Support: 1,000+ concurrent edits
- Throughput: 100+ successor creations per second

## Integration Points

### Workflow System
- Edit operations can trigger approval workflows
- Automated edits may bypass human approval
- Rollback operations integrate with audit requirements

### Event Sourcing  
- All edit operations generate events
- CID changes recorded in event stream
- Complete audit trail of who/what/when

### Access Control
- Edit permissions checked before successor creation
- CID chain access controls inherited or overridden
- Audit trail includes permission context
