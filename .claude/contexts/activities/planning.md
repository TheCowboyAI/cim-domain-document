# ðŸ“‹ Planning Activity Context

*Focus on architecture, design, and strategic planning*

## Activity Purpose
Planning involves designing systems, modeling domains, and creating implementation strategies before writing code.

## Core Planning Activities

### Domain Modeling
- Event storming sessions
- Bounded context identification  
- Aggregate design and boundaries
- Value object definition

### Architecture Design
- System component identification
- Service boundary definition
- Integration point mapping
- Technology stack decisions

### Implementation Planning
- Feature breakdown and prioritization
- Development milestone definition
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Resource and timeline estimation

## Planning Tools and Techniques

### Event Storming
```
1. Gather domain events (DocumentCreated, DocumentVersioned)
2. Identify commands that trigger events
3. Map actors and systems involved
4. Define aggregate boundaries
5. Identify integration points
```

### Domain-Driven Design
- **Ubiquitous Language** - Common terminology across team
- **Bounded Contexts** - Clear domain boundaries
- **Context Maps** - Integration patterns between contexts
- **Strategic Patterns** - Anti-corruption layers, shared kernels

### Architecture Patterns
- **Event Sourcing** - Store events, not state
- **CQRS** - Separate read and write models  
- **Saga Patterns** - Long-running transactions
- **Microservices** - Service per bounded context

## Planning Outputs

### Design Documents
- Domain models and bounded contexts
- Event catalog and schemas
- Service architecture diagrams
- Integration patterns and APIs

### Implementation Plans
- Feature specifications and acceptance criteria
- Development phases and milestones
- Testing strategies and requirements
- Deployment and operational considerations

### Risk Assessments
- Technical complexity analysis
- Dependency identification and management
- Performance and scalability considerations
- Security and compliance requirements

## Planning in Document Domain

### Domain Events to Model
```
// Core document lifecycle
DocumentCreated, DocumentUpdated, DocumentVersioned
DocumentArchived, DocumentDeleted, DocumentRestored

// Content intelligence events  
ContentAnalyzed, MetadataExtracted, TemplateDetected
SearchIndexUpdated, SimilarityCalculated

// Workflow integration events
DocumentSubmitted, ApprovalRequested, ApprovalGranted
DocumentPublished, DocumentWithdrawn
```

### Aggregates to Design
- **Document Aggregate**: Core document data and behavior
- **Version Aggregate**: Version history and comparisons
- **Template Aggregate**: Document templates and patterns
- **Search Aggregate**: Index and query management

### Integration Points
- **Identity Service**: User authentication and permissions
- **Storage Service**: Document persistence and retrieval
- **Workflow Service**: Approval and routing processes
- **Notification Service**: Event publishing and alerts

## Planning Process

### 1. Discovery Phase
- Stakeholder interviews and requirements gathering
- Current state analysis and pain point identification
- Domain expert consultation and knowledge extraction
- Competitive analysis and best practice research

### 2. Modeling Phase  
- Event storming and domain modeling sessions
- Bounded context definition and context mapping
- Aggregate and entity identification
- Value object and domain service specification

### 3. Architecture Phase
- System architecture design and documentation
- Technology stack selection and justification
- Integration pattern definition and specification
- Non-functional requirement analysis

### 4. Planning Phase
- Feature prioritization and roadmap creation
- Development milestone definition and sequencing
- Resource allocation and timeline estimation
- Risk assessment and mitigation planning

## Tools and Documentation

### Diagramming Tools
- **Mermaid** for system and process diagrams
- **Event Storming** boards for domain modeling
- **Context Maps** for integration patterns
- **Service Maps** for system architecture

### Documentation Templates
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Domain model documentation
- API specifications and contracts
- Testing strategies and plans

### Collaboration Tools
- Design review sessions and feedback loops
- Stakeholder alignment meetings
- Technical spike planning and execution
- Prototype development and validation

## Quality Criteria for Planning

### Completeness
- All domain concepts identified and modeled
- Integration points clearly defined
- Non-functional requirements addressed
- Risk mitigation strategies in place

### Clarity
- Documentation is clear and unambiguous
- Diagrams accurately represent system design
- Terminology is consistent and well-defined
- Assumptions and constraints are explicit

### Feasibility
- Technical approach is realistic and achievable
- Resource requirements are reasonable
- Timeline estimates are evidence-based
- Dependencies are manageable
