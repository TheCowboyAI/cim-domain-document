# ðŸ“ˆ Progress Tracking - Simplified

*Streamlined progress tracking for systematic development*

## Core Concepts

### Definition of Done
Every task follows this progression:
1. **DESIGNED** - Architecture and approach planned
2. **PLANNED** - Implementation steps defined  
3. **IMPLEMENTED** - Code written
4. **VERIFIED** - Code compiles and runs
5. **TESTED** - Tests pass
6. **COMPLETE** - Feature works end-to-end
7. **DONE** - Production ready

### Progress States
- **pending** - Not started
- **in_progress** - Currently working on
- **completed** - Finished successfully
- **blocked** - Cannot proceed (document blockers)

## Progress Tracking Methods

### 1. TodoWrite Tool (Primary)
```bash
# Use for immediate task management
TodoWrite: [
  {"id": "1", "content": "Implement document creation", "status": "in_progress"},
  {"id": "2", "content": "Add content validation", "status": "pending"},
  {"id": "3", "content": "Write integration tests", "status": "pending"}
]
```

### 2. Git Commits (Secondary)  
```bash
# Capture completion with git hashes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement document creation

ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Capture hash for progress tracking
CURRENT_HASH=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
echo "Completed task at commit: $CURRENT_HASH"
```

### 3. Progress Documentation (When Needed)
Only for major milestones or when explicitly requested:
```markdown
## Progress Update $(date -I)

### Completed
- Document aggregate implementation
- Basic CRUD operations  
- Unit tests for core functionality

### In Progress
- Content intelligence service
- Search integration

### Next Steps
- Integration tests
- NATS message handlers
- Performance optimization

### Blockers
- None currently
```

## Simplified Workflow

### Before Starting Work
1. **Check context**: `bash .claude/scripts/detect-context.sh`
2. **Create todo list**: Use TodoWrite for task breakdown
3. **Mark task in progress**: Update todo status

### During Work
1. **Update todos**: Mark completed tasks immediately
2. **Add new todos**: As requirements emerge
3. **Document blockers**: In todo content if encountered

### After Completing Work
1. **Mark todo complete**: Update status to "completed"
2. **Commit changes**: With proper commit message
3. **Update major progress**: Only if significant milestone

## Quality Gates

### Before Marking Complete
- [ ] Code compiles: `cargo build`
- [ ] Tests pass: `cargo test`  
- [ ] Linting passes: `cargo clippy`
- [ ] Format applied: `cargo fmt`
- [ ] New features tested
- [ ] Documentation updated (if public APIs)

### Before Marking DONE
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Ready for production use

## Progress Patterns

### For Small Features (< 1 day)
1. TodoWrite with task breakdown
2. Implement with TDD
3. Mark todos complete as finished
4. Single commit when feature complete

### For Medium Features (1-3 days)
1. Design document (brief)
2. TodoWrite with detailed tasks
3. Daily progress updates in todos
4. Multiple commits with clear messages
5. Progress summary at completion

### For Large Features (> 3 days)
1. Architecture design document
2. Implementation plan with phases  
3. TodoWrite for current phase
4. Weekly progress documentation
5. Milestone commits with tags
6. Final completion summary

## Integration with Memory System

### When to Update External Progress
Only update files outside TodoWrite when:
- Major milestone reached (e.g., new service implemented)
- Architecture decisions made
- Integration points established
- Production deployment completed

### Memory File Updates
- **memory/state.md**: Current working context and focus
- **memory/context-map.md**: Major component relationships
- **memory/git-state-tracking.md**: Critical commit hashes

## Commands Reference

### Progress Tracking Commands
```bash
# Check current git state
git status
git log --oneline -5

# Get current date for progress entries  
CURRENT_DATE=$(date -I)

# Check compilation and tests
cargo build && cargo test

# Create progress commit
git add -A
git commit -m "progress: $(date -I) - feature milestone reached"
```

### Todo Management
- **Create**: TodoWrite with new task list
- **Update**: TodoWrite with status changes
- **Complete**: Mark status as "completed" immediately
- **Block**: Update content with blocker description

## Avoiding Over-Documentation

### Don't Create Unless Asked
- No automatic README updates
- No automatic documentation files
- No progress reports unless requested
- No milestone summaries unless significant

### Focus on Code
- Code is the primary deliverable
- Tests demonstrate functionality
- Git history shows progress
- TodoWrite tracks immediate work

### Document When Necessary
- Architecture decisions (ADRs)
- Breaking changes
- Public API changes
- Integration requirements

*Simplified progress tracking focused on delivery over documentation*  
*Use TodoWrite for immediate tracking, git for history, docs only when necessary*
