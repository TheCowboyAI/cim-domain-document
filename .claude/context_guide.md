# üß≠ Context Guide - Understanding Where You Are

*Clear framework for determining your current context and focus*

## üéØ Three Types of Context

### 1. üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Context
**Where your code runs in the CIM architecture**

- **Client** - Local NATS, development environment
- **Leaf** - Single node hosting services  
- **Cluster** - 3+ leaf nodes for high availability
- **Super-cluster** - 3+ clusters for global scale

*Detected by: `bash .claude/scripts/detect-context.sh`*

### 2. üéØ Domain Context  
**What business domain you're working in**

- **Document** - Document management, versioning, content intelligence
- **Identity** - Authentication, authorization, user management
- **Network** - Routing, switching, IP management, connectivity
- **Workflow** - Process orchestration, state machines, task management
- **Storage** - Persistence, caching, data retrieval
- **Communication** - Messaging, notifications, NATS integration

*Determined by: Repository name (cim-domain-*) and business requirements*

### 3. üé¨ Activity Context
**What you're currently doing**

- **Planning** - Architecture, design, event storming
- **Coding** - Implementation, TDD, feature development  
- **Testing** - Unit tests, integration tests, verification
- **Debugging** - Fixing errors, troubleshooting, analysis
- **Documentation** - User guides, API docs (only when asked)

*Determined by: User's current request and task type*

## üö® Context Priority Rules

### Context Hierarchy
1. **Activity Context** (highest priority) - Determines immediate approach
2. **Domain Context** (medium priority) - Determines business focus  
3. **Infrastructure Context** (lowest priority) - Determines deployment patterns

### Decision Framework
```
What should I focus on RIGHT NOW?

1. ACTIVITY: What am I doing?
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Planning ‚Üí Use architectural patterns, event storming
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Coding ‚Üí Follow TDD, event-driven patterns
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Testing ‚Üí Focus on coverage, verification
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Debugging ‚Üí Analyze errors, fix compilation
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Documentation ‚Üí Create only when explicitly requested

2. DOMAIN: What business problem?
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Document ‚Üí Content intelligence, versioning, metadata
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Identity ‚Üí Auth, permissions, user lifecycle  
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Network ‚Üí Routing, connectivity, IP management
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Workflow ‚Üí Process orchestration, state transitions
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [Other domains] ‚Üí Specific business logic

3. INFRASTRUCTURE: Where does it run?
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Client ‚Üí Local development, testing
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Leaf ‚Üí Single service deployment
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cluster ‚Üí High availability, failover
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Super-cluster ‚Üí Global scale, multi-region
```

## üìç Context Detection Commands

### Quick Context Check
```bash
# Detect infrastructure context
bash .claude/scripts/detect-context.sh

# Check current domain
basename $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)

# Determine activity from user request
# (analyzed contextually from conversation)
```

### Full Context Analysis
```bash
# Repository context
echo "Repository: $(basename $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel))"
echo "Current branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
echo "Working directory: $(pwd)"

# Git status for current activity
git status --porcelain

# Available services/modules
ls -la src/ 2>/dev/null || ls -la services/ 2>/dev/null

# Recent activity
git log --oneline -5
```

## üéØ Context-Specific Guidelines

### Planning Context
- Focus: Architecture, event storming, design patterns
- Tools: Mermaid diagrams, event modeling, DDD patterns
- Output: Design documents, architectural decisions
- Read: [patterns/domain-driven-design.md](./patterns/domain-driven-design.md)

### Coding Context  
- Focus: TDD, event-driven implementation, Rust best practices
- Tools: Cargo, tests, event sourcing patterns
- Output: Working code, passing tests
- Read: [standards/rust-coding-standards.md](./standards/rust-coding-standards.md)

### Testing Context
- Focus: Verification, coverage, integration testing
- Tools: Cargo test, integration tests, property testing
- Output: Test suites, coverage reports
- Read: [standards/test-driven-development.md](./standards/test-driven-development.md)

### Debugging Context
- Focus: Error analysis, compilation fixes, troubleshooting
- Tools: Compiler output, logs, debugging traces
- Output: Fixed code, resolved issues
- Read: [troubleshooting.md](./troubleshooting.md)

## üîÑ Context Switching

When context changes:
1. **Acknowledge the switch** - "Moving from coding to testing context"
2. **Adjust approach** - Different tools, patterns, focus areas
3. **Update progress** - Mark previous context tasks complete
4. **Reference appropriate docs** - Context-specific guidelines

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Context Confusion

### What NOT to conflate:
- **Infrastructure ‚â† Domain** - Where code runs vs. what business problem
- **Current Activity ‚â† Repository Type** - What you're doing vs. what repo contains
- **Domain ‚â† Service** - Business area vs. technical component

### Context Boundaries:
- Stay focused on current activity until complete
- Don't jump between domains without completing tasks  
- Keep infrastructure concerns separate from business logic
- Activity context trumps other contexts for immediate decisions
